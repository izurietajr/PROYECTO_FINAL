abstract = {Recently, Biometrics-based personal identification is regarded as an effective method of person's identity with recognition automation and high performance. In this paper, the palmprint recognition method based on Hu invariant moment is proposed. And the low-resolution(75dpi) palmprint image(135Ã—135 Pixel) is used for the small scale database of the effectual palmprint recognition system. The proposed system is consists of two parts: firstly, the palmprint fixed equipment for the acquisition of the correctly palmprint image and secondly, the algorithm of the efficient processing for the palmprint recognition. And the palmprint identification step is limited 3 times. As a results, when the coefficient is 0.001 then FAR and GAR are 0.038{\%} and 98.1{\%} each other. The authors confirmed that FAR is improved 0.002{\%} and GAR is 0.1{\%} each other compared with online palmprint Identification algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2008,
abstract = {Classifying plant leaves has so far been an important and difficult task, especially for leaves with complicated background where some interferents and overlapping phenomena may exist. In this paper, an efficient classification framework for leaf images with complicated background is proposed. First, a so-called automatic marker-controlled watershed segmentation method combined with pre-segmentation and morphological operation is introduced to segment leaf images with complicated background based on the prior shape information. Then, seven Hu geometric moments and sixteen Zernike moments are extracted as shape features from segmented binary images after leafstalk removal. In addition, a moving center hypersphere (MCH) classifier which can efficiently compress feature data is designed to address obtained mass high-dimensional shape features. Finally, experimental results on some practical plant leaves show that proposed classification framework works well while classifying leaf images with complicated background. There are twenty classes of practical plant leaves successfully classified and the average correct classification rate is up to 92.6{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cervantes2017,
abstract = {The development of vision systems for identifying plants by leaves is an important challenge which has numerous applications ranging from food, medicine, industry and environment. Recently, several techniques have been proposed in the literature in order to identify plants in various fields of application. However, current techniques are restricted to the recognition and identification of plants using specific descriptors. In this paper, is accomplished a comparative analysis using different methods of feature extraction (textural, chromatic and geometric) and different methods of classification. The experiments are executed on very similar plants. Twelve sets of leaves with similar shape characteristics are studied using several classifiers. The performance of different combinations of classifiers-descriptors are analyzed in detail for each set. The results show that a combination of different feature extraction techniques is necessary in order to improve the performance. This combination of descriptors is more necessary when the leaves have similar characteristics.},

@article{Hu1962,
abstract = {In this paper a theory of two-dimensional moment invariants for planar geometric figures is presented. A fundamental theorem is established to relate such moment invariants to the well-known algebraic invariants. Complete systems of moment invariants under translation, similitude and orthogonal transformations are derived. Some moment invariants under general two-dimensional linear transformations are also included. Both theoretical formulation and practical models of visual pattern recognition based upon these moment invariants are discussed. A simple simulation program together with its performance are also presented. It is shown that recognition of geometrical patterns and alphabetical characters independently of position, size and orientation can be accomplished. It is also indicated that generalization is possible to include invariance with parallel projection. {\textcopyright} 1962, IEEE. All right reserved.},
